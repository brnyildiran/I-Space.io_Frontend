## I-Space.io_Frontend
In our age, people like to share their interests and discover things that match their interests. In this project, we aim to create a website where people can share and vote simultaneously for movies, TV shows, music, and artworks based on a user-specific information database. Our motivation is to create a platform where our users can give feedback on the works they are interested in, and where content producers can produce their works in a better quality way. This website will make things easier and faster as people can easily find a movie to watch, music to listen to and a new piece of art to experience, moreover, producers who learn about users' interests will be able to create more popular works, and a double-sided gain will emerge. There will be categories such as movies, TV series, music, and art, and according to these categories, people will be able to vote, comment on their experiences, find new things to discover based on the votes of others, and reveal information about the demand.
